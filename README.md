# Old readme
This Github repository is for requesting Openplanet plugin signatures. Plugin signatures can be required in Trackmania, if you want players to use your plugin on Starter or Standard subscriptions. [More info can be found here.](https://openplanet.nl/next/club)

# How do I get my plugin signed?
Start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/openplanet-nl/plugin-signing/issues/new/choose) to this repository. Follow the issue template and upload your plugin or script as an issue attachment. You might need to put the file(s) in a zip to make the upload work. Submit the issue, and someone will reply soon!

If you're still unsure about the process, you can look at the [closed issues](https://github.com/openplanet-nl/plugin-signing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to see how it works.
